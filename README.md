# TeleKey

TeleKey is a remote keyboard interface for working on two computers at once.
Pressed keys are encrypted and transmitted using Protobuf over a
TCP Connection.

## Features

- Connect two computers on the same local network
- End-to-end encryption using X25519 and ChaCha-Poly1035
- Cross platform (tested on Windows, macOS and Ubuntu)


## Quick Start

Syntax:
```bash
$ telekey.exe [OPTIONS]
```

### üìù Start as client
A Telekey Client will receive key events and emulate the key presses.

```bash
$ telekey.exe -t 127.0.0.1
```
By default (without any options), TeleKey will try to connect to **127.0.0.1:8384**.
And all received keys will be emulated on the system (real key presses).

### üßë‚Äçüíª Start as server
Telekey Server will listen and send key events to the Telekey Client.

```bash
$ telekey.exe -s 0.0.0.0
```
By default (without any options), TeleKey will send all keys typed in the stdin of
the program.

## Options

Option Syntax follows the Unix-standard. Combined options and equal-seperated options are accepted.
| Usage                       | Description                                                                                                    | Default        |
|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|
| -t, --target-ip <IP[:PORT]> | [Runs telekey as client] Defines the target address to connect to                                              | 127.0.0.1:8384 |
| -s, --serve <IP[:PORT]>     | [Runs telekey as server] TCP port to listen to                                                                 | 0.0.0.0:8384   |
| -m, --simple-menu           | If enabled, server's menu will only show minimal information and only update latency                           | `false`        |
| -c, --cold-run              | If enabled, the key presses will be printed to the standard output rather than being emulated                  | `false`        |
| -l, --refresh-latency <n>   | Triggers a latency check after `n` keys. Use **0** to disable latency checks.                                  | 20             |
| -u, --unsecure              | Unsecure mode. No encryption: use it at your own risk!                                                         | `false`        |
| -h, --help.                 | Print help version (list of options and usage)                                                                 | N/A            |
| -v, --version               | Print version information                                                                                      | N/A            |


## Installation

### Requirements
- Rust version 1.60 minimum (not tested on older versions)

```bash
  cargo build
```
    
## Todo

- [x] Graphical User Interface
- [x] End-to-end encryption
- [x] Improve End-to-end encryption to prevent key-dictating (+man in the middle) attacks
- [x] Command Line Interface
- [ ] Add missing keys
